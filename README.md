# SguWeewx
Bespoke skin to produce files &amp; images from [WeeWx](https://weewx.com/) to go into the [SGU Pilot's Wiki](https://pilots.scottishglidingcentre.co.uk/), which is created using [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/)

The aim of this skin is to make it as simple as possible to install WeeWx and have it produce the required output in a structure that can be copied using FTP to the Pilot's Wiki server.

The file & image names, and paths, are all specific to the [SGC Weather Station](https://pilots.scottishglidingcentre.co.uk/weather/weather_station) and [SGC Weather Statistics](https://pilots.scottishglidingcentre.co.uk/weather/weather_stats) pages.

The skin can be downloaded from https://github.com/swfrx/SguWeewx/releases and is installed in the usual way with ['wee_extension'](https://weewx.com/docs/utilities.htm#wee_extension_utility).  

  * I recomend that Weewx is installed with [setup.py](https://weewx.com/docs/setup.htm) into the default location of ``/home/weewx``.
  * Turn off the default ``SeasonsReport`` by in the ``[[SeasonsReport]]`` of ``weewx.conf``, changing ``enable = true`` to ``enable = false``.
  * The DokuWiki server needs a user for FTP that the WeeWx platform can connect to, and with a home directory that is the [DokuWiki data](https://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:dirlayout) directory.  That directory contains the ``media`` and ``pages`` subdirectories.
  * The [FTP](https://weewx.com/docs/usersguide.htm#If_the_server_is_on_a_different_machine) or [RSYNC](https://weewx.com/docs/usersguide.htm#If_the_server_is_on_a_different_machine) section needs configuring with the correct server, path, user and password as per the DokuWiki server.  The home directory on the remote server should be where the ``dokuwiki`` installation is.
  * By default ``$HTML_ROOT`` is ``/home/weewx/public_html/sguweewx``, and this skin places it's output in ``$HTML_ROOT/dokuwiki`` from where new and altered content is copied to the main DokuWiki server.
  * No WeeWx configuration beyond that mentioned above should be required.
  * The correct [DokuWiki namespace](https://www.dokuwiki.org/namespaces) for the NOAA files in DokuWiki is ``weather:noaa:``  
  
This skin produces the following pages and images:

   * $HTML_ROOT/dokuwiki/media/weather/daywind-sgu-big.png
   * $HTML_ROOT/dokuwiki/media/weather/daywind-sgu.png
   * $HTML_ROOT/dokuwiki/pages/weather/noaa/noaa-yyyy-mm.txt - one file per month per year
   * $HTML_ROOT/dokuwiki/pages/weather/noaa/noaa-yyyy.txt - one file per year
   * $HTML_ROOT/dokuwiki/pages/weather/weather_stats_incl.txt
   * $HTML_ROOT/dokuwiki/sguweewx.html
 
``sguweewx.html`` is a file that can be used to view the images and statistics in a test situation.  It is not accessed on the live system.

``weather_stats_incl.txt`` is a file in [DokuWiki table format](https://www.dokuwiki.org/wiki:syntax#tables).  It's intended that it is [included](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:include) in a DokuWiki page to display the most recently generated weather statistics - see [Weather Statistics](https://pilots.scottishglidingcentre.co.uk/weather/weather_stats).

The fonts used in the images - OpenSans-Bold.ttf and OpenSans-Regular.ttf - are included in the skin. 

The WindRose files are generated by the [PolarWindPlot skin](https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-polarwindplot) which has been included in this sking.  Permission was kindly granted by the author, who also gave a lot of help along the way.
